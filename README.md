<h2>Project Steps</h2>
<h3>First: </h3>
We draw the ERD for this project using <b>PowerDesigner</b>

<h3>Second: </h3>
We converted the ERD to physical model (DDL scripts)

<h3>Third: </h3>

We developped the software application using C# and connected the database to be able to perform all the application functions like: sign-in, add game, update game and browse all games that are stored in our database.
